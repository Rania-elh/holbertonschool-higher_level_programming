Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python is a software development approach where tests are written before writing the production code. The main idea is to follow an iterative cycle with three steps:

Write a test: Before writing the functional code, you write a test that describes the functionality you want to implement.
Write the code: You then write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass.
Refactor: After writing the code, you improve and optimize it while ensuring that the tests continue to pass.
This cycle is repeated for each new feature or modification.
