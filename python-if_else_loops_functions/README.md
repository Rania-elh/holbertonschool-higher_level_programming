1. The for loop
Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, string, or range of numbers).
Executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.
Ideal when you know the number of iterations in advance (for example, looping through a list or range of numbers).
2. The while loop
Executes as long as a condition is true.
Useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on the condition.
Itâ€™s important to update the condition inside the loop to avoid an infinite loop.
3. Controls within loops
break: Used to exit a loop prematurely, even if the condition is not yet false.
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
else: Can be used with a loop. The else block executes if the loop completes normally (i.e., without being interrupted by a break).
In summary:
Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, while the while loop runs as long as a condition is true. The break, continue, and else commands control the flow of execution within loops.
